# Raw_Data-to-Clean_data-using-EDA

### Project Description: Transforming Raw Data to Clean Data Using Python EDA
#### Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of transforming raw data into a clean, ready-to-use dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. This project involves loading raw data, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and applying exploratory data analysis techniques to ensure data quality and readiness for further analysis or modeling.
